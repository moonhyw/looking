This repository contains the source code for the project "Are you looking at the camera?". It is divided in four folders with the following structure:
1. looking --> to preprocess, train and evaluate the looking model.
2. annotator --> to annotate new images using openpifpaf and a GUI.
3. process_data --> to process the created annotations.
4. multi_dataset --> to evaluate on JackRabbot, nuScenes, PIE datasets.

The four folders are made to run independently. Each of the folders and subfolders contains their own README.
