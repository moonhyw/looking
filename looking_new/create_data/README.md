# Dataset creation

Since we are running multi-modal training, the multi model dataset is a bit tricky to create. Please follow carefully the instructions below to configure and build the datasets

## Create the JAAD dataset 

First clone [JAAD repo](https://github.com/ykotseruba/JAAD) in your machine and download the JAAD dataset. In order to download JAAD dataset, clone the repo above, run ```sh download_clips.sh``` and ```sh split_clips_to_frames.sh```. Download also the keypoints from pifpaf [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zUAUALzhOuaaqYcogZdmpq6jTqSst6eL/view) and extract them in your machine. A folder named ```output_pifpaf_01_2k30``` should be outputted after the extraction.

* Run ```python3 dataset.py --path [path_to_JAAD_repo] --path_joints [path_to_extracted_joints_folder] --dir_out [path_to_the_directory_to_store_the_images_and_the_keypoints]```. This process can take up to an hour
* Run ```python3 split.py --gt_name [name_of_gt_txt_file] --txt_out [folder_of_txt_files]``` to create the splits

Add paths

## Create the Kitti dataset

* ```chmod +x create_kitti.sh```
* ```./create_kitti.sh```

## Create JackRabbot dataset

* ```chmod +x create_jr.sh```
* ```./create_jr.sh```

## Create Nuscenes dataset

* ```chmod +x create_nu.sh```
* ```./create_nu.sh```
